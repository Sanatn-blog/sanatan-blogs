# Bug Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the bugs that were identified and fixed in the Sanatan Blogs project.

## 1. Dependency Version Incompatibility (Fixed ✓)
**Issue**: lucide-react version 0.294.0 didn't support React 19
**Fix**: Updated lucide-react to version ^0.525.0 which supports React 19

## 2. Security Vulnerability - Outdated Multer (Fixed ✓)
**Issue**: Project was using multer 1.x which has known security vulnerabilities
**Fix**: Removed multer entirely as it wasn't being used - the app uses Next.js native file handling

## 3. Missing Environment Variable Error Handling (Fixed ✓)
**Issue**: Using non-null assertions (!) on environment variables would crash before error messages
**Fix**: Updated `lib/mongodb.ts` and `lib/jwt.ts` to check environment variables before using them

## 4. Undefined JWT_REFRESH_SECRET (Fixed ✓)
**Issue**: Code was using JWT_REFRESH_SECRET which was never defined
**Fix**: Updated code to use JWT_SECRET for refresh tokens instead of undefined variable

## 5. Security Risk - Hardcoded Admin Credentials (Fixed ✓)
**Issue**: setup-admin route had hardcoded fallback credentials ('admin@sanatanblogs.com', 'admin123')
**Fix**: Removed hardcoded values and added validation to require proper credentials

## 6. Missing Environment Documentation (Fixed ✓)
**Issue**: No example environment file for developers
**Fix**: Created `.env.local.example` with all required environment variables documented

## 7. Build-time Environment Variable Access
**Issue**: Build fails because MongoDB connection attempts to run at module load time
**Note**: This is a known limitation when building without environment variables. The app will work correctly when proper environment variables are provided at runtime.

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

1. **Add Environment Variable Validation**: Create a validation script that checks all required environment variables on startup
2. **Implement Proper Error Boundaries**: Add React error boundaries to handle runtime errors gracefully
3. **Add Health Check Endpoint**: Create an endpoint to verify all services are properly configured
4. **Update Social Auth Implementation**: The social auth code references undefined environment variables and may need refactoring
5. **Add Input Validation**: Ensure all API endpoints have proper input validation
6. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints
7. **Add Logging**: Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring

## How to Run the Fixed Application

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in all required environment variables
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` for development or `npm run build && npm start` for production
